Methods.  Cox proportional hazards model and logistic regression were used to correlate early changes in galactomannan index (GMI) to mortality and overall response, respectively, from patients with positive baseline GMI (≥0.5) and serial GMI during treatment from a phase 3 clinical trial for the treatment of invasive mold disease. Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) analysis in patients with isavuconazole plasma concentrations was conducted to establish the exposure necessary for GMI negativity at the end of therapy. Results.  The study included 158 patients overall and 78 isavuconazole patients in the PK/PD modeling. By day 7, GMI increases of >0.25 units from baseline (3/130 survivors; 9/28 who died) significantly increased the risk of death compared to those with no increase or increases <0.25 (hazard ratio, 9.766; 95% confidence interval [CI], 4.356–21.9; P < .0001). For each unit decrease by day 7 from baseline, the odds of successful therapy doubled (odds ratio, 2.154; 95% CI, 1.173–3.955). An area under the concentration-versus-time curve over half-maximal effective concentration (AUC:EC50) of 108.6 is estimated to result in a negative GMI at the end of isavuconazole therapy. Conclusions.  Early trends in GMI are highly predictive of patient outcome. GMI increases by day 7 could be considered in context of clinical signs to trigger changes in treatment, once validated. Our data suggest that this improves survival by 10-fold and positive outcome by 3-fold. These data have important implications for individualized therapy for patients and clinical trials.","2017-06-01","2021-10-14 10:42:31","2021-12-14 16:24:32","2021-11-01 15:12:45","1557-1563","","11","64","","","Pharmacodynamics of Isavuconazole for Invasive Mold Disease","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/agerada/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Zotero/Journal Article/Kovanda et al_2017_Pharmacodynamics of Isavuconazole for Invasive Mold Disease2.pdf; /Users/agerada/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Zotero/Journal Article/Kovanda et al_2017_Pharmacodynamics of Isavuconazole for Invasive Mold Disease.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

ESAs dosing is currently based on clinical protocols that often do not account for the high inter- and intra-individual variability in the patient’s response. As a result, the hemoglobin level of some patients oscillates around the target range, which is associated with multiple risks and side-effects. This work proposes a methodology based on reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize ESA therapy. Methods: RL is a data-driven approach for solving sequential decision-making problems that are formulated as Markov decision processes (MDPs). Computing optimal drug administration strategies for chronic diseases is a sequential decision-making problem in which the goal is to ﬁnd the best sequence of drug doses. MDPs are particularly suitable for modeling these problems due to their ability to capture the uncertainty associated with the outcome of the treatment and the stochastic nature of the underlying process. The RL algorithm employed in the proposed methodology is ﬁtted Q iteration, which stands out for its ability to make an efﬁcient use of data. Results: The experiments reported here are based on a computational model that describes the effect of ESAs on the hemoglobin level. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated and compared with the well-known Q-learning algorithm and with a standard protocol. Simulation results show that the performance of Q-learning is substantially lower than FQI and the protocol. When comparing FQI and the protocol, FQI achieves an increment of 27.6% in the proportion of patients that are within the targeted range of hemoglobin during the period of treatment. In addition, the quantity of drug needed is reduced by 5.13%, which indicates a more efﬁcient use of ESAs. Conclusion: Although prospective validation is required, promising results demonstrate the potential of RL to become an alternative to current protocols.","2014-09","2021-11-01 14:41:47","2021-11-01 14:41:47","2021-11-01 14:41:47","47-60","","1","62","","Artificial Intelligence in Medicine","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/agerada/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Zotero/Journal Article/Escandell-Montero et al_2014_Optimization of anemia treatment in hemodialysis patients via reinforcement.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Instead of specifying a discrete sequence of hidden layers, we parameterize the derivative of the hidden state using a neural network. The output of the network is computed using a blackbox differential equation solver. These continuous-depth models have constant memory cost, adapt their evaluation strategy to each input, and can explicitly trade numerical precision for speed. We demonstrate these properties in continuous-depth residual networks and continuous-time latent variable models. We also construct continuous normalizing ﬂows, a generative model that can train by maximum likelihood, without partitioning or ordering the data dimensions. For training, we show how to scalably backpropagate through any ODE solver, without access to its internal operations. This allows end-to-end training of ODEs within larger models.","","2021-11-01 12:27:12","2021-11-01 12:27:12","","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/Users/agerada/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Zotero/Journal Article/Chen et al_Neural Ordinary Differential Equations.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
